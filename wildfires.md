description: Satellite Image Analysis to Detect, Assess and Suggest Intervention Strategies for Wildfires
---

This project seeks to apply AI to address wildfire, a serious environmental issue. Continuing increases in wildfire occurrences is detrimental to the ecosystem of rainforests, and has direct consequences for the climate. Naturally occurring wildfires can spark during dry weather and droughts. However, more than 80 percent of the wildfires is said to result from human causes, including unattended camp and debris fires, discarded cigarettes, and arson.
 
This project has three aims: (i) to detect and monitor the occurrence of wildfire, and predict its size, spread and behaviour; (ii) to assess the cause of the wildfire; (iii) to suggest strategies of fire suppression and prevention.
