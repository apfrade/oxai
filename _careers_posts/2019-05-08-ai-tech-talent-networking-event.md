On May 8th, OxAI’s Careers Team collaborated with the Oxford Foundry to host our first AI Tech Talent Networking Event. A variety of exciting multinational companies and rising start-ups, who are leading global AI innovations, were invited to showcase their businesses. The event attracted over 100 graduate and undergraduate students interested in careers in AI, whether they were actively looking for a job/internship, or were just curious about what the market offers.

The evening kicked off with a series of short pitches by 10 companies, introducing their work, ambitions and job opportunities. An hour of structured networking sessions then offered students and company representatives the opportunity to meet each other and engage in meaningful conversations. While the students learned about the different products, the research behind them and what it’s like to work in the industry, the companies advertised their brands and vacancies among the Oxford student community. The event ended with an hour of open networking, during which everyone enjoyed the free drinks and canapes.

Due to the positive feedback, OxAI and the Oxford Foundry are planning to organise another AI Tech Talent Networking Event in the fall, with different companies more opportunities to learn, exchange ideas and meet inspiring, ambitious people. Stay tuned!
