The Emerging Technologies Party was a coming together of Oxford’s main student societies that focus on emerging tech. The event provided an opportunity for students to gain an understanding of the emerging technologies scene at Oxford in a relaxed environment, with music, food and drinks provided. It also offered the societies a chance to recruit new members and develop potential collaborations.

At the event itself, the societies had their own stands that were being staffed by enthusiastic representatives, who explained what it is that they do and the possible ways to join or contribute to them. The societies were also presenting any demos that they had developed, with some 3D-printed products created by the Oxford Robotics and Additive Manufacturing Society (OxRAM) proving particularly popular. After some initial networking, the societies had the opportunity to get on stage and provide a short introductory presentation about their activities to the whole room.

This event was one of the highlights of the OxAI calendar and marked the second successful year of the Emerging Technologies Party. Don’t worry if you missed out this year, as OxAI plans to collaborate with these societies again in the 2019-2020 academic year!
