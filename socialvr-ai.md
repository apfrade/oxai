title: AI in virtual social environments
description: Virtual developmental robotics in a social VR environment
---

The aim of this project is to build a framework to for AI resarch in social virtual reality (VR) environments. The main motivations are to gain insight into human behaviour, and to explore how social interactions with humans in complex environments can benefit the development of artificial intelligence for different applications. This idea builds on top of research in robotics, reinforcement learning (RL), and psychology, among others. However, research in human-AI and human-human social interaction has been limited by the use of expensive robots and sensing systems. We propose to massively scale up and lower the barrier for these types of experiments by using new VR technologies.

Our approach is to build a software framework on top of an existing social VR application (e.g. [NeosVR](https://neosvr.com/), [VRChat](https://www.vrchat.com/)), and to test this framework by experimenting with novel learning algorithms, and novel learning tasks and environments.

27/11/2019 We made a [seminar in Neos VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zReWBVZBuas&t=3205) introducing some of the motivations behind the project (and [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/106DzzXIqv38yzSEHU4z07CcfHOEzo5YNH6Ee5V7tboo/edit?usp=sharing) from that)
